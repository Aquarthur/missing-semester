# missing-semester

Exercise solutions and/or notes from https://missing.csail.mit.edu/. Please note - I am aware that most of these notes are copy/pasted from the lectures. I mostly type them up to help me remember.

## Longer term exercises

A lot of topics the lectures go into are too big for a single lecture. Here's a list of things that I want to spend more time on:

* Vim
* regex
* `sed`
* `awk`
* `tmux`
