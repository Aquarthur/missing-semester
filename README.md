# missing-semester

Exercise solutions and/or notes from https://missing.csail.mit.edu/. Please note - I am aware that most of these notes are copy/pasted from the lectures. I mostly type them up to help me remember.

## Longer term exercises

A lot of topics the lectures go into are too big for a single lecture. Here's a list of things that I want to spend more time on:

* Vim
  * `vimtutor`
  * [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
    * Finished the free part, need to spend $25 for the personal license if I want to keep going!
  * [Vim Advent Calendar](https://vimways.org/)
  * [Vim Golf](http://www.vimgolf.com/)
  * [Vim Tips Wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki)
* regex
  * [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/)
* `sed`
* `awk`
* `tmux`
